    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Think of today’s recipe as a cross between moussaka and risotto. But so much easier to make than both of them!</p>
    <p>It channels moussaka vibes with eggplant and beef mince cooked in a red-wine tomato sauce, heavy on the garlic and oregano (Greece approves!). And it’s got the hallmarks of a great risotto, with the juicy, oozy rice. Never stodgy, never mushy.</p>     
    <p>It’s not authentic anything. But it’s very, very tasty, and a really handy one-pot meal for those times when you want something straightforward to make that’s filling, cosy and a little bit different. Because – what do you mean you’ve never cooked rice with eggplant before?? It works so well! Eggplant is a sponge for flavour. It soaks up all that garlicky, tomatoey, beefy flavour that bursts in your mouth when you bit into a piece!</p>
